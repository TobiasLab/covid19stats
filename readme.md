In this app you’re able to view statistics about a large list of different countries for the current SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) Coronavirus pandemic.
 
The UI Components I’ve used are CountryListActivity and DetailsActvity. CountryListActivity will display a few global stats as well as a recyclerview that is scrollable to view specific stats for every country. If you click on one of the countries, you are directed to the DetailsActivity, which will display more specific statistics for that country.

The frameworks, libraries, patterns etc. I’ve used for this assignment:
- Coroutines
- MVVM
- LiveData
- Retrofit
- CardView
